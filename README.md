# Tuinue Wasichana

## Overview

**Tuinue Wasichana** is a donation management platform built to support organizations that provide menstrual hygiene solutions, clean water, and sanitation to school-going girls in sub-Saharan Africa. The platform enables donors to make one-time or recurring donations, allows charities to manage beneficiary stories and donations, and equips administrators to manage charity applications and overall system integrity.

The initiative seeks to reduce school absenteeism among girls due to a lack of sanitary products by encouraging consistent charitable giving and impact-driven storytelling.
